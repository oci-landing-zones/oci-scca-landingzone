Oracle Enterprise Landing Zone V2 and CIS Landing Zone V2 solutions have now been merged to the new [OCI Landing Zone Core](https://github.com/oci-landing-zones/oci-landingzone-core).  This solution is ideal for organizations that prefer a single-click deployment with prescriptive guidance to deploy OCI services.
If your organization needs to onboard one to multiple entities into OCI, such as organization units, LoBs, subsidiaries, customers/partners, or any type of managed services, the [Operating Entities Landing Zone](https://github.com/oci-landing-zones/oci-landing-zone-operating-entities) is the right starting point. All Landing Zones support the [CIS V2.0 Benchmark](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/oracle_cloud).

We have revamped all the core modules to include more functionality:
